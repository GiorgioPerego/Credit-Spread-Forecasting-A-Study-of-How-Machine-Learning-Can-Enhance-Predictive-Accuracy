Credit Spread forecasting via Machine Learning (XGBoost, RF) and Deep Learning (TCN). The project integrates mixed-frequency macro data using MIDAS algorithms and employs Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for regime detection, significantly enhancing predictive accuracy and regime-conditioned risk analysis (VaR/ES).
